           <p id ="topicBio" class ="bio"><span class ="j">A</span>lexandar Karp, owner of Palantir, software data-mining company has a networth of<strong> US$1.9 billion</strong>. 
            Rasided in Philadelphia he lived a modest middle-class life. Excellling in acadmics he earned a bachelors degree from harvard College. Fun fact he was classmates with Peter Thiel, venture capitalist and co-founder of Pay-Pay. A company that revolutionized the way we transfer currencly to each-other. He later co-founded his major source of capital. <strong>Palanir</strong>, a software data mining company. The software helps companys intergrare their own personal data, decisions, and operations. Powerful, helping companys of many niches I would say become able to more or less accurately gather data and trends to predict future operations, allowing for clean preperation and execution. Thought, this comany is under a lot of scruntity; under-going allegations concerning breach of privacy within the public sector. Being that a major supply of capital is from contracts issues to the United States goverment. Palantir is under a lot of conspiracy  theorist fire. For good reason to.

          Seen as eccentric philisophical leader. Usually sporting around bright colored athletic wear, being drawn to fitness and health, and lover of martial arts. Cherry on top according to forbes he's able to solve a rubix cube  in under 3 mins.
