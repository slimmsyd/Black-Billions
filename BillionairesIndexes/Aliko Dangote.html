He is coined the richest man in Africa. His faimly game from uhm,  wealth, his grand-father Sansui Dangote was the richest man in Africa earned his leving by  selling <strong>commodities</strong> such as rice, wheat, and beans. Dangote continue the family trade, he ventured out with a loan from his grandfather and began to import <strong>soft-commodities</strong> such as soybeans, cocoa, coffee, cototn, sugar, raice, wheat and livestock alike. This did exremelty well. Evolvoing for him not being the directy distributro to become the creator. After 20 years, in importation. He built plants for the exact thing he was buying, pasta, sugar, salt, and four.

            He as well participates in philanthropic work partnering with the Bill and Melenda Gates foundation in 2013 to eradicate poolio and strenghten routine immunizations, in August 2020. 
            My thoughts. Wealth simply generates more wealth. Relationships as well is a key component to successful ventures. Ownership can generalize it all, the provider of the value we as consumers stive to attain; that need we innately try to resolve. Becoming the Owner, is is what it comes down to on a holistic level. But that value lies in now understanding and questoning yourself, what are the steps that I can take to achive that level of ownership. Break it down to the most simpliest habit.  .The question arises how does one attain ownership?
