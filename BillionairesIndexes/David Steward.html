           <p id ="topicBio" class ="bio"><span class ="j">D</span>avid Steward... Black American entrepernaur with a nested networth of <strong>$4 billion</strong> US dollars. The founder and chainman of IT provider World Wide Technology. His rise to success wasn't a easyone. Growing up in extreme porverty, predjuidice, and racism. Their was a lot of hurdles to climb. A lot of doubt to overcome. At one point in time David Stern was the only black boy in his school.Nevertheless he found this rise to success through grit and determination. <strong>Bootsrapping</strong> his compnay. Literally building from the ground up with nothing but personal savings and a hint of Aristole luck. This shows unreaveld pride and determination, also provides a bit of sadness. A approach quite common to African Americans because we have the least wealth and capital compared to other groups in this counrty. As well as unsufficient inhertance from earlier generations.
