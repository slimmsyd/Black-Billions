This man is nested to have a estimated networth of $6 billion in US dollars. Quite the feat, quite the inspiration. Though I believe the inspiration lies in the path that he took to achive his wealth. In America, especially in the black community. We find that our black leaders and those sole to have high income reside in the entertainment industry. Usually the pioneers of culture. Yet this man took a different route. A educated route into the trenches of finance and enginerring, as well as heavy education. Let's not get confused; no way of the lonley warrior is wrong. A way is a way.Though biasedly I find that this way is much more needed. It preaches a path to more education and innovation than residing in the niche of making money and driving culture.
